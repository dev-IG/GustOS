    ; Step 1: Set up the stack
    ; This will give your bootloader some workspace in memory

    ; Step 2: Check system requirements
    ; For example, you might check that the CPU is an x86-64 processor

    ; Step 3: Enable A20 line
    ; This allows your bootloader to access memory above 1MB

    ; Step 4: Switch to protected mode
    ; This gives you access to 32-bit operations and memory protection features

    ; Step 5: Set up paging
    ; This is required to switch into long mode

    ; Step 6: Switch to long mode
    ; This gives you access to 64-bit operations and larger address space

    ; Step 7: Load your kernel into memory
    ; You'll use BIOS interrupts to read your kernel from the disk

    ; Step 8: Jump to your kernel's entry point
    ; This transfers control from your bootloader to your kernel
